To keep our sanity and not stomp over one another's commits
unnecessarily we have adopted the Linux coding standard as defined
here https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle with the
following exceptions:

* While I like tabs and fundamentally agree with the Linux folks
  logic, method names are sometimes necessarily long and 4 spaces is
  just easier to work with and keep consistent.  Thus we use spaces only
  and keep it at 4 spaces for indentation.  This also is close to what
  exists in the current code base, so its less of a drastic change.

* Simple one line IF statements happen _on the same line_.  Rationale
  is that its more readable and helps to prevent mistakes where a
  programmer forgets to include braces around the IF statements.  If
  its not easily readable, break it into a multi-line if statement
  with braces.
