There are alternate Linux tool available via 3rd parties.

Instructions:

**Save your configuration

WARNING: Updating firmware restores the default configuration on RaceCapture/Pro
Be sure to save your configuration using the Race Analyzer software.

Download the new firmware and firmware update utility from Downloads section
You will need both the flasher utility as well as the firmware image you wish to use.

Place these downloaded files in a known directory on your computer. for example, c:\firmware

**Connect RaceCapture/Pro in Bootloader Mode

while holding down the front panel button connect RaceCapture/Pro to your computer using the USB cable.
You should observe the power LED, and the two rightmost green LEDs illuminated steady. You can now release the front panel button.
RaceCapture/Pro is now in bootloader mode

**Install flasher device driver
If this is your first time installing new firmware, you will need to install the device drivers for the flasher utility. The drivers are included with the firmware update utility zip file. Download Here
Install the bootloader drivers by running at the command line:
c:\firmware>bootloader_drivers.exe
Answer yes to the all of the prompts before proceeding.

**Important Notes
RaceCapture/Pro must be connected to the computer in bootloader mode when the drivers are installed. See previous step.
You won't have to do this again the next time you load new firmware

**Open a command prompt
Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where you placed the downloaded files.
e.g. for Windows:
cd c:\firmware

**Issue firmware flash command
At the command prompt, issue the command flasher RaceCapturePro-X.X.X.elf where X.X.X represents the firmware version. Example:
c:\firmware>flasher RaceCapturePro-1.1.6.elf

The flasher application should find the RaceCapture/Pro device and then start flashing new firmware. The red front panel LED on RaceCapture/Pro will flash while firmware is written.

Once the firmware completes flashing, RaceCapture/Pro will reset and run normally with the default configuration.
